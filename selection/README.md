# Wright-Fisher population dynamics

### Wright-Fisher model

![](images/wright_fisher.png)

There are *N* individuals in the population. Every generation, each individual has a Poisson number of offspring (looking forwards in time), or picks one random parent individual (looking backwards time). Generations are discrete and non-overlapping.
